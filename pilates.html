    <p>The traditional exercise system as developed by Joseph Pilates is as much a workout for the mind as it is for
      the body. The Pilates Method is a focused journey through a complete system of mind-body exercises. The wellness
      journey inspires discipline &amp; insight as a valuable tool to overcome obstacles, cope with everyday problems,
      develop resilience to reduce inner conflict, become emotionally more balanced, and gain resourcefulness and
      increased vitality.</p>
    <p>
      Pilates is a deeply focused mind/body method of conditioning that effects the wellbeing of the whole person.
      Pilates is based on the traditional exercises devised by Joseph Pilates. Learning to move your body efficiently
      will invoke flexibility, strength & agility.
      Private, Matwork & Circuit lessons run for 50-55 minutes. Virtual & face to face options are available.

    <p>
      The Pilates Method is a system of exercise that was designed by Joseph Pilates to be taught with one instructor
      to one client. During your private sessions, we will develop an individualized program to best suit your body's
      needs, working around any injuries, making you stronger and more flexible. More advanced clients benefit from
      private instruction to improve precision, add new exercises to their Pilates workout, work on a specific issue
      or on rehabilitation from injury.
