# Bay-Pilates-Wellness

Live Site: [baypilateswellness.com](https://baypilateswellness.com/)

Pilates &amp; Wellness site for Isabelle.

I chose to do this site as static pages instead of React because 1) there was no back-end server needed, 2) I thought it would be faster than coding it in React (which I was wrong about because I had to update every nav bar on each page), and 3) I wanted some more practice with basic HTML and CSS.

Looking back on it, I wish I had used React because it became increasingly frustrating to do any general changes on one page and then have to copy paste them on the other pages. I think that React is a little bit more work setting up in the beginning but in the long run for updating sites it is much, MUCH better.
